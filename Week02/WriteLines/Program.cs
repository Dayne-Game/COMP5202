            //The content should not be the actual answer, but the calculation

            //2: Print the answer of divding 2 numbers
            //The content should not be the actual answer, but the calculation

            //3: Print the answer of adding 2 numbers together using 2 variables
            //The content should not be the actual answer, but the calculation

            //4: Write the code for these calculations:
            // * -1 + 4 * 6
            // * ( 35+ 5 ) % 7
            // * 14 + -4 * 6 / 11
            // * 2 + 15 / 6 * 1 - 7 % 2
            
            //5: Write the code to swap numbers 
            // * Create 3 variables, int a = 20, int b = 30, int c
            // * Print out variable a and b with the title "number 1 = 20 and number 2 = 30" etc.
            // * Now reassign the variables, but don't redeclare them so that a = 30, b = 20
            // * Now print them out again  "number 1 = 30 and number 2 = 20"
