# Introduction to the course

This course will cover the fundamentals of programming and problem solving, but before we can begin, we need to set up the tools we are using for this course.

# What I need

You can complete this course on any PC, and the tools we use are available on multiple operating systems.
The only thing you need to do is install the tools required to complete the course.

Although it does not matter what System you use (Windows, Linux or macOS), I recommend that you use the latest of each of these.

* For Windows, this is Windows 10 (Creative or Anniversary Edition)
* For Linux, this course assumes you use Ubuntu (16.04LTS)
* For macOS, use Sierra or High Sierra (when it comes out)

Also note that all the screenshots are made on a mac, but will look the same on any other system. If something is  different, then multiple screenshots/videos will be provided.

# Programs

**[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (vscode)**  

The  IDE (Integrated Development Environment) we will use is Visual Studio Code.
Although you can use any text editor you wish, all the demo's will use VSCode for consistency. In addition to that, all the coding you do in this course can be completed using vscode.

| Windows | Mac | Linux |

| [Download](https://vscode-update.azurewebsites.net/latest/win32/stable) | [Download](https://vscode-update.azurewebsites.net/latest/darwin/stable)| [Download]((https://vscode-update.azurewebsites.net/latest/linux-deb-x64/stable)) |

<br>
**[Git](https://git-scm.com)**

To save and manage our code we will use git. Git is also the tool that is used to submit your assignments.
The course will introduce you in detail on how to use the basics of git. Note you will not be able to use USB sticks and upload your files any other way.

| Windows | Linux | macOS |

| [download here](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.13.1.windows.2/Git-2.13.1.2-64-bit.exe) | Open the Terminal using `Ctrl+Alt+T` and type in `sudo apt-get install -y git`  | Open the Terminal using spotlight and type in `xcode-select --install` |

## Services
<br>

---

**[Github](https://github.com/join?source=header-home)**

---

Next, you need to create an account on [github.com](https://github.com); this is where you will save all of your work.

The advantage of this is that you can access your files from any machine, including ones outside of the lab computers and you don't need to bring anything to anywhere.

In the first class, we will go through this process, if you have not done so already. 

* For your username, you must use this format **`firstname_lastname`**
* For your email address, you can use your email account or your `@g.toiohomai.ac.nz` account.

---

**[Slack](https://to-bcs.slack.com/)**

---

You can signup using your `@g.toiohomai.ac.nz` account. It must be this one, as we limit sign-ins to this account to limit who can access the channels.

---

**[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com)**

---

You can access your drive and emails using your `studentid@g.toiohomai.ac.nz` Google email account, with that, comes Google Drive with unlimited space. Don't store your code on there as it can mess with the binaries. 
You can, of course, use it store docs, images and anything else. This account will be active forever so you can safely store your stuff on there.

## Portfolio

<br>
For this course, you will set up a portfolio for what you have created. Google Drive allows us to save our Google Site as a new document so that everything is in the same folder.

Your code will go on Github, but everything else will be 
setup on this site and shared with me (`jk11@g.toiohomai.ac.nz`) or made public.

This portfolio is used to see how you do with your tutorial tasks and will be useful for your job applications in the future. You will not get any grades for your portfolio, although it serves as a tool that is useful for your assessments and future projects, and therefore you must keep it up to date so that you can receive feedback on your progress

You can also use it to store your coding journal.  
To learn more about the concept of a coding journal have a look at this video.

## Class Setup

The hours each week for this course are set up in a 2 - 1 - 2 format.

The first 2-hour lab we will go over a concept showing examples using the C# language. The other 2-hour lab we do the same in JavaScript.

The 1-hour lab is a `WindowsKey+L` session where we discuss the topic or concept at hand without using the computer. This 1-hour session might in some cases be the most valuable.
