This course is going to leverage a lot of external documentation and other media. This means you will use real-world examples and explanations of industry experts in addition to what is covered in this course directly.

Microsoft has a dedicated website to teach to code in C#. This course is not a blanket copy of this website so not everything will be done. What you do not do in this course, you can do as extra practice in your own time.

For now go to this website and complete the first page, so that you become familiar with a C# document. (Click on the image)
