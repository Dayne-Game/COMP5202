## Tutorial 1: Get a Peer Coding Partner

---

This tutorial may seem relatively straightforward, but it is one that requires a bit of research. The research is in getting to know your classmates.  
Earlier in this course, there was a video on what Peer Programming is, so have a look through that, if you skipped it or want a refresher.  
Once you have picked a team partner, Go through the next set of tutorials as a peer-coding-team.

## Tutorial 5: Setting up Code Snippets

---

When we code, we often repeat certain code blocks or patterns quite often. Some of them are complicated and some not so much.  
However, some are tedious - for example, what if every time you started a project you had to retype the beginning and end part of a program?  
Let's have a look at how we make life a little easier using user code snippets.
