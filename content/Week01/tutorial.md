## Into to tools and methods

## Tutorial 1: Get a Peer Coding Partner

---

This tutorial is may seem relatively simple, but it is one that requires a bit of research. The research is in getting to know your classmates.  
Earlier in this course there was a video on what Peer Programming is, so have a look through that, if you skipped it or want a refresher.  
Once you have picked a team partner, Go through the next set of tutorials as a peer-coding-team.

## Tutorial 2: Explore Visual Studio Code

---

Visual Studio Code is an open source lightweight code editor. It has the option to add extensions, just like most modern web browsers these days. To learn more about Visual Studio Code read through this link:

## Tutorial 3: Create your first program and commit it to Gtihub

---

In this tutorial you are going to explore Github. Github is a place where you manage, store and share your code. This web app is basically a front end to some of the options that is provided by Git - Github is basically a pretty face for it.
For this tutorial task you do not need to create a program. Simply create a text file and add some content in it and upload that.
* Create a folder called test on your Desktop
* Create a file (just a plain text file, not a word document) and add in your name and student ID 

* // Finish this

## Tutorial 4: Code your first application

---

This tutorial is a bit of a process to get through, but will get easier with practice. When you are done with it, work on it with a another student and explain the process. If you do not need this document you are well on your way to manage this process.
The document is 8 pages long, but you won't need to do everything every time, some of the parts focus on installing dotNet Core - which is a one time process.

Right click and open this link in a new page:

All the tutorials are available for you to comment on. If you have any feedback add a comment and your student id number so I get can back to you or thank you for the feedback.

## Tutorial 5: Deploying your application

---

Deploying your application means you are ready to set it up so other people can use it.  
So far you the app(s) you have run have been done inside a development environment. All the tools you need have been installed. What if you want to show your application on a machine that doesn't have these tools installed?  
Full on windows / macOS and Linux apps will need to be packaged and can run from a single file.  
dotNetCore is slightly different, yes there is a single application file, but it is in a folder that has the dependencies with it. This might and hopefully will change in the future, but for now it is about keeping it all inside a folder.  
Now the platform will still create an executable file and you can still run that by double-clicking on it - so let's have a look at how to do that.  
Once you have published your app you will need to do a git commit to update the changes in your repository

## Tutorial 6: Setting up Code Snippets

---

When we code, we often repeat certain code blocks or patterns quite often. Some of them are complicated and some not so much.  
However some are tedious - for example what if every time you started a project you had to retype the beginning and end part of a program?  
Let's have a look at how we make life a little easier using user code snippets.

## Tutorial #7 - Looking at Documentation

---

The internet is loaded with documentation and videos to find what we need to learn programming.
So far we have looked at the console class and how some of the methods work.  
We can find the documentation for the console class here:  

[MSDN System.Console](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.console(v=vs.110).aspx)

To get to that website it is as simple as searching in Google for MSDN C# Console Class

The Console Class has a lot of properties and Methods and we will only use a small selection of them. However it is interesting to look at some.

Let's have a look at the following methods and properties:
* Foreground Color
* WriteLine
* ReadLine
* Clear
* ResetColor
