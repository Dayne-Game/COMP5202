## Pair Programming

---

Pair programming is an important skill to have, but it is also a fairly new concept. Basically you share a single machine between 2 people or you have someone else view your screen as you code.

Watch this little video about what pair programming is and team up with someone in your class.

Note that you are helping each other and it also means you need to be able to tell someone when they are wrong. Don't abuse this power though - not everyone gets it right the first time, or the second, or third.....

Before you watch this video, you need to log into moodle.
For this use the link at the top of this page.

## .Net Core Tutorial

---

This course is going to leverage a lot of external documentation and other media. This means you will use real-world examples and explanations of industry experts in addition to what is covered in this course directly.

Microsoft has a dedicated website to teach to code in C#. This course is not a blanket copy of this website so not everything will be done. What you do not do in this course, you can do as extra practice in your own time.

For now go to this website and complete the first page, so that you become familiar with a C# document. (Click on the image)

## What is Programming

---

Watch this video that will give you a brief introduction on what programming is.  
Note: Some of the videos I show you in this course are part of another course, since they are from their own series.  
Although you are free to watch them (I can't stop you ) be aware that this course follows a different path to match the Degree pathway.  
So do this course work first, then if you have time spare - watch the other videos if you like.
