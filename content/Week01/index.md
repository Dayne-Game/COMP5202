## The goal of this paper

---

This paper is going through a demo & doing approach.
This means that in the class for the first half we demo and go through programming concepts using 2 languages.

In the second half you are going then going to learn a new language using the methods of learning you did in the first half.

By the end of the course, in addition to the learing outcomes you will also have the skills to pick up new languages a lot easier, because you know how to think about the process and know where to find the information.

## Setting up your workstation

---

On the [Home page](./) you will see what software you need to download and install. Visual Studio Code makes use of extension, like you do with your browser. You will be shown which ones to install as we use them.

> Tip: Create a repository for your extensions, so that it is easy to install them when you are working on multiple machines.

## Learning multiple languages

---

This course is about the concepts more than the languages that you will use. Although we use programming languages to display examples, not everything works exactly the same in each language. See it as speaking in different accents or talking in a different language all together. Depending on what we code we may want to use a specific language for one thing, and another for something else.

This course indicates to you what language an example belongs to and what differences to keep in mind.

## Why C#?
C# is the main language used by Microsoft and is used to write Windows apps. It is used in a lot of situations, anything from console apps, to complete Windows apps, cross platform web and mobile apps.

## Why JavaScript?
Javascript is the [number one](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#most-popular-technologies) language when it comes to coders favourites and to 
Similar to C# is allows you to make apps on all platforms and work with different frameworks to create your own projects a lot easier. 

Once you are happy with these two you are able to adopt other languages a lot easier.
 
The third language you are going to cover is Swift

This is a fairly new language, it is open source and is the native language for iOS and Mac apps. It also has some options for backend web development.

## Pair Programming

---

Pair programming is an important skill to have, but it is also a fairly new concept. Basically you share a single machine between 2 people or you have someone else view your screen as you code.

Watch this little video about what pair programming is and team up with someone in your class.

Note that you are helping each other and it also means you need to be able to tell someone when they are wrong. Don't abuse this power though - not everyone gets it right the first time, or the second, or third.....

Before you watch this video, you need to log into moodle.

## What is Programming

---

Watch this video that will give you a brief introduction on what programming is.  
Note: Some of the videos I show you in this course are part of another course, since they are from their own series.  
Although you are free to watch them (I can't stop you ) be aware that this course follows a different path to match the Degree pathway.  
So do this course work first, then if you have time spare - watch the other videos if you like.

## Using Git

---

The use of git tightly integrated into the programming and web papers.
You can read up about the use of it here:

* [Using git locally on your machine](/setup-git)
* [Pushing your code to a remote repository](/remote-git)
